::: info
Here, languages are the only dividing lines. For example, Golang includes but is not limited to the Golang ecosystem, such as the rpc framework grpc, the microservice framework Go-Zero, the contract interaction framework Geth, the sql framework Gorm, the network framework Gin, etc.

There is also the full Java stack, along with other frameworks like ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ, and Kafka. I am currently an intern backend developer at a mid-sized company in China.

I have also been exposed to frontend basics like TypeScript and frameworks such as the Vue ecosystem.
