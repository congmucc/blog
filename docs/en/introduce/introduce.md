::: info
Here, languages are the only dividing lines. For example, Golang includes but is not limited to the Golang ecosystem, such as the rpc framework grpc, the microservice framework Go-Zero, the contract interaction framework Geth, the sql framework Gorm, the network framework Gin, etc.

There is also the full Java stack, along with other frameworks like ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ, and Kafka. I am currently an intern backend developer at a mid-sized company in China.

I have also been exposed to frontend basics like TypeScript and frameworks such as the Vue ecosystem, and some smart contract frameworks like React's RainbowKit and Wagmi. However, my current career plan is to focus on backend development for WEB3 contracts.

## Personal Direction

My current goal is to become a backend development engineer for smart contracts, with a long-term plan to progress towards an architect role. However, this may change as my experience and knowledge grow.

## Some Random Thoughts

I transitioned from Java to WEB3, first encountering the blockchain direction of WEB3 at the end of 2023. I was attracted by the concept of decentralization and subsequently conducted research, learning that the development in China is quite difficult. In 2019, blockchain was even banned once in China, but in recent years, it has been included in the country's new infrastructure.

I started learning in 2023, albeit intermittently. It's been quite challenging. I still remember the first introductory course I listened to, which was taught by a professor from MIT. He used the example of Wikipedia, saying that centralization always has omissions, but if it were decentralized, this problem wouldn't exist. Hearing this concept made me think a lot; the idea of decentralization is truly great.

In my middle school years, I served as class monitor, and in university, I also collected forms and worked in student management. The main difference between these roles and being a regular student is the need to consider many aspects. When there are many people, cooperation cannot be guaranteed. However, with the concept of decentralization, if it becomes an organization like DAO, it would be different. This idea is really great and made me fall in love with blockchain. So after completing my research, I decided to enter the WEB3 industry. Keep going!
